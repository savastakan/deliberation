# A Novel E-Participation Model for Deliberation Processes

Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have laid the foundations for electronic participation (e-participation) and created a rapidly expanding academic literature. This study aims to contribute to the literature on developing e-deliberation processes in business management and social issues by starting with the question, "How can we make better use of digital opportunities in deliberation and decision-making processes carried out through e-participation?". In this direction, a new e-deliberation model has been developed with a holistic approach based on the requirements such as open data, transparency, traceability, reliability, low complexity, and interdisciplinary approaches that stand out in the existing literature on e-participation. For this purpose, firstly, a new data structure inspired by the blockchain was developed to ensure procedures such as transparency, traceability, reliability, and low complexity. Then, the e-deliberation design, which incorporates the possibilities of social media, such as synchronization and social network patterns, is integrated into the data structure we have developed. Our model is expected to be an alternative option to support democratic decision-making processes.
